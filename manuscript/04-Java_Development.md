# Java Development

## Code Principals

We try to follow these general principles and by adhering to these simple guidelines, we feel that our code is more readable, easier to follow and is testable (even though we can always do better so please give us constructive feedback):

* Write code so others can read and understand it.
* Write testable code.
* Unit tests everything, but no need to strive for 100%.
* A method should not be longer than a page (if it is, you probably can split it up).
* Javadoc everything! Please describe what each class/interface is supposed to do. If you cannot explain it, then no one else will be able to understand it either. Each method should be documented. Describe what the method is supposed to do. If you end up writing an essay about the method, perhaps it is too complicated?

## Style Guide

Please follow the style already in place. In general, the code base is following regular java style convention but here are the more important points (and some differences)

* No tabs â€“ ever
* Indent is 4 spaces
* The line width is 120 characters so please do not cut it off at 80 (we all have screens with high enough resolution these days).
* Use final everywhere! 
* Use this everywhere!
